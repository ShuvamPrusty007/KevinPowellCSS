            Specificity is a weight that is applied to a 
            given CSS declaration, determined by the number 
            of each selector type in the matching selector. 
            When multiple declarations have equal specificity,
            the last declaration found in the CSS is applied 
            to the element. Specificity only applies when the 
            same element is targeted by multiple declarations. 
            As per CSS rules, directly targeted elements will 
            always take precedence over rules which an element 
            inherits from its ancestor.
